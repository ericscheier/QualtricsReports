# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R
Markdown see <http://markdown.rstudio.com>

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Sample code to illustrate R code highlighting
summary(cars)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Define the cars vector with 5 values
cars <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)

# Graph cars
barplot(cars, col=rainbow(5))
```
